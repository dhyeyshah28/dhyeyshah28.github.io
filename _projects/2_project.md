Used latent trajectory representations to improve Behavioral Cloning for robotic manipulation tasks in a kitchen environment, by training a Variational
Autoencoder on low-dimensional state data to capture motion intent, phase, and context to reduce reliance on vision in constrained environments.
Integrated a LLM to translate natural language instructions into 3D spatial goals, enabling multi-object manipulation achieving efficient task execution
in Robosuite simulations.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.



The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
