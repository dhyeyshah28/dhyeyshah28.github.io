Implemented a PPO-based reinforcement learning pipeline for autonomous quadrotor racing, emphasizing end-to-end policy learning in Isaac Sim while also testing it on the Crazyflie hardware system. Formulated physics-informed reward functions and observation encodings to balance stability with aggressive maneuvering through gate sequences, while leveraging curriculum learning and domain randomization in Isaac Lab for policy robustness.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.



The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
