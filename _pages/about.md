Hey!👋 I’m **Dhyey Shah**, a second-year **Master’s student in Robotics (MSE)** at the
<a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/academics/programs/robotics/" target="_blank">University of Pennsylvania</a>, where I am advised by
<a href="https://nbfigueroa.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Nadia Figueroa</a>. Prior to this, I completed my **Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering** from
<a href="https://pdeu.ac.in/" target="_blank">PDEU, India</a>.

I am broadly interested in building **end-to-end robotic systems**, with a focus on developing **novel control frameworks for human-centred robotic environments**. My recent technical and course <a href="/projects/">projects</a> focus on domains such as **computer vision**, **machine learning**, and **reinforcement learning–based control strategies** for applications including robot manipulation and autonomous navigation for aerial and ground robots.

Apart from spending time surrounded by cool robots, I also like spending time around humans. I love to **play and watch sports** (cricket, tennis, badminton, rock-climbing). My other <a href="/hobbies/">hobbies</a> include **painting**, **reading** (psychology, philosophy, and neuroscience), and **writing**—often journaling or expressing my thoughts through short poetry.

Growing up in **Gujarat, India**, I fluently speak **English, Hindi, and Gujarati**, and am currently learning Spanish.
