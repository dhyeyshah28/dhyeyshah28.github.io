learn ⇄ design ⇆ build

I’m **Dhyey Shah**, a second-year **Master’s student in Robotics (MSE)** at the 
<a href="[#](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/academics/programs/robotics/)" target="_blank">University of Pennsylvania</a>, where I am advised by 
<a href="[#](https://nbfigueroa.github.io/)" target="_blank">Prof. Nadia Figueroa</a>.

I am broadly interested in building **end-to-end robotic systems**, with a focus on
**novel control frameworks for human-centric robotic environments**. More recently,
I have been fascinated by **reinforcement learning–based control strategies** for
applications such as **robotic manipulation** and **aerial robotics**.

At the <a href="[#](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/)" target="_blank">GRASP Lab</a>, I currently work with the 
<a href="[#](https://nbfigueroa.github.io/)" target="_blank">Figueroa Robotics Lab</a> on the development of an 
**upper-limb exoskeleton** for assistive and resistive training in collaborative
human–robot environments. Previously, I worked with the 
<a href="[#](https://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/)" target="_blank">Kod*Lab</a> on **template-based control methods for legged robots**.
You can find more details about my research and publications on my 
<a href="/research/">Research</a> page.

Beyond research, I have gained industry experience as a **Software Development Intern**
at <a href="[#](https://www.modalai.com/)" target="_blank">ModalAI</a>, where I worked on **real-time image processing
and vision-based control pipelines for UAVs**. I have also served as the **SLAM lead**
for a social indoor robot developed for the second round of the 
<a href="[#](https://www.sick.com/us/en/sick-10k-challenge/w/10K-Challenge)" target="_blank">SICK $10K LiDAR Challenge</a>.
A complete overview of my technical and course projects can be found on my
<a href="/projects/">Projects</a> page.

Outside the lab, I enjoy spending time around people as much as robots. I actively
play and follow sports such as **cricket, tennis, badminton, and cycling**, and have
recently been exploring **rock climbing**. I also enjoy hiking with friends, painting,
reading, and writing—often journaling or expressing thoughts through poetry.

I have a long-standing curiosity about **psychology**, **philosophy**, and
**neuroscience**, particularly in understanding human behavior and cognition.
Growing up in **Vadodara, Gujarat**, I fluently speak **English, Hindi, and Gujarati**,
and am currently learning **Spanish**.
